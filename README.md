# command-line-arguments-to-count-word
## AIM:
To write a python program for getting the word count from the contents of a file using command line arguments.
## EQUIPEMENT'S REQUIRED: 
PC
Anaconda - Python 3.7
## ALGORITHM: 
### Step 1:
Create a file object and get file name from the user
### Step 2: 
 Open the file given by the user
### Step 3: 
Using for loop acess the file
### Step 4:  
Use split funtion to separate the words
### Step 5: 
The words is then counted by len function
### Step 6: 
Print the number of words


## PROGRAM:
